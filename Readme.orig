PolyMARS Version 1.0

******************************************************************************
DOCUMENTATION

More documentation about the polyMARS program is available on request.


******************************************************************************
FILES

The unwrapped package contains the files 

Makefile         is.polymars
ReadMe           polymars
f2c.h            plot.polymars
library.help     predict.polymars
polymarsall.S    print.polymars
polymarsall.c    summary.polymars
polymars.tex
fig1.eps
fig2.eps

********************************************************************************
MAKEFILE

The Makefile can make 2 files:

polymars.so  - needed for dyn.load.shared()
polymars.o   - needed for dyn.load()

Depending on your compiler you may need to change some of the options in the 
Makefile. The compile command is either

make polymars.so
or 
make polymars.o

********************************************************************************
S-CODE

The file polymars.S contains the code for the S functions that are
related to the polymars program. They can be loaded by sourcing polymars.S from S.

*******************************************************************************
HELPFILES
The files polymars, predict.polymars, plot.polymars, is.polymars, summary.polymars
and polymars.persp contain the helpfiles for the S functions. They should
be placed in a directory .Data/.Help.  This assumes that your system reads
the helpfiles using some form of nroff.

********************************************************************************
LOADING THE OBJECT FILES
You may need to edit the function polymars in polymarsall.S appropriately for loading.
This function contains the line 

    dyn.load.shared("/usr/local/splus33/library/polymars/polymars.so")

It may need to be changed to 
   
    dyn.load.shared("/where/your/files/are/polymars.so")

or 

    dyn.load("/where/your/files/are/polymars.o")


********************************************************************************
LIBRARY

One possible way to install the programs is to put them in a library.
How to do this:
- find out where the S(Splus) code is located - if you don't know this,
  the easiest way is to type   getenv("SHOME") inside S(Splus).
  Let's say that this is /usr/lang/splus
- cd to this directory, and go further down to the library directory
  under this directory (cd /usr/lang/splus/library).
- make a directory polymars under this directory (mkdir polymars)
- move ALL the polymars related files into this directory
- in /usr/lang/splus/library/polymars execute 
  % mv library.help README
  % make polymars.so or make polymars.o
  % vi/emacs polymars.S as indicated above
  % mkdir .Data
  
  % ls .Data    (this is in fact /usr/lang/splus/library/polymars/.Data)
   (Should contain polymarsall.S, polymarsall.c .....and no files that are not
   polymars related)
  % mkdir .Data/.Help
  % mv  polymars predict.polymars plot.polymars is.polymars .Data/.Help
  % mv  summary.polymars polymars.persp .Data/.Help
   (These are the helpfiles in /usr/lang/splus/library/polymars not the
   executables in /usr/lang/splus/library/polymars/.Data)
   This assumes that you have nroff.
  % S (or Splus)
  > source("polymarsall.S")
  > help.findsum.d(".Data") ( this sets up helpfiles for window-based help) 
  > q()
A user wanting to use the polymars program would now, once per session,
execute the command
   library(polymars)
which she/he could put in her/his .First function.
